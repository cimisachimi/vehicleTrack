- **Live Status Updates:** Data is refreshed every 5 seconds to provide the latest information on vehicle status, speed, fuel level, and destination.
- **Detailed Vehicle Pages:** View comprehensive information for each vehicle, including key metrics, a fuel progress bar, and a map showing its historical route.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-friendly interface ensures a seamless experience on all devices, with a scrollable table for medium screens.
- **Backend Data Simulation:** A realistic vehicle movement simulation runs on the server to generate live tracking data, including fuel consumption, odometer updates, and a 5-minute refueling cycle when fuel is low.

### **Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- A running PostgreSQL database instance

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup**

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create an environment file
cp .env.example .env

Update the newly created .env file with your database connection string and a JWT secret:

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_long_and_random_jwt_secret"

Finally, set up the database and start the server:
Bash

# Apply database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database with sample data
pnpm run seed

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev

The backend server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:
Bash

# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev

The frontend will be running on http://localhost:5173 and will be configured to communicate with your local backend.
